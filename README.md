Project Title:Speech Emotion Recognition(SER) 

This repository contains the code for a speech emotion recognition (SER) model that was trained on the Toronto Emotional Speech Set (TESS). TESS is a dataset of audio recordings of two actresses speaking 200 target words while expressing seven emotions: anger, disgust, fear, happiness, pleasant surprise, sadness, and neutral.

In this project I have been used two algorithms one is LSTM and another is Decision Tree.LSTM algorithm gives the value accuracy of 99% and Decision Tree gives 90%.So bot are better algorithms for this but LSTM is better.

The code in this repository is written in Python and uses the following libraries:

Librosa: for audio analysis
TensorFlow: for deep learning
Keras: for high-level neural network API
Ipython:Interactive frontends, and a rich set of magic commands.
sklearn: used to work with large datasets and complex calculations.
The repository also includes a Jupyter notebook that walks through the process of training and evaluating the SER model.

This repository is a valuable resource for anyone interested in speech emotion recognition. The code is well-documented and easy to follow, and the Jupyter notebook provides a step-by-step guide to training and evaluating the SER model.

Features:

The model is trained on the Toronto Emotional Speech Set (TESS), a large and diverse dataset of audio recordings.
The model achieves an accuracy of 99% on the TESS test set.
The code is written in Python and uses the following libraries: Librosa, TensorFlow, sklearn,Ipython and Keras.
The repository includes a Jupyter notebook that walks through the process of training and evaluating the SER model.
Benefits:

The model can be used to recognize emotions in speech, which can be used for a variety of applications, such as customer service, healthcare, and security.
The code is well-documented and easy to follow, making it a valuable resource for researchers and developers.
The Jupyter notebook provides a step-by-step guide to training and evaluating the SER model, making it easy to get started with speech emotion recognition.
I hope this repository is helpful to you. Please feel free to contact me if you have any questions.
